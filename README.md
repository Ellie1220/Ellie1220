### Hi, I'm Ellie Lu 👋

I'm currently studying for a Master of Business Analytics in Suffolk University and love to explore new technologies and build exciting projects. 
✨I'll be sharing my latest endeavors right here on GitHub.

🔭 I’m currently working on honing my skills in Python programming and machine learning with SAS. 

🌱 I’m currently learning about natural language processing and deep learning techniques.

💬 I'm also interested in Supply Chain Management and analyzing Supply Chain Data using machine learning and exploratory data analysis techniques.

📫 You can reach me via email at aichenlu1997@gmail.com or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ai-cheng-lu-37375a189).

⚡ Fun fact: I was also a veterinary assistant at an exotic animal hospital for six years! 🐾
